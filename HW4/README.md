A critique of NHRT [The earth is round (p0.05) - Cohen 1994](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~dift3913/cours/papers/cohen1994_The_earth_is_round.pdf)

# HOMEWORK

## Assignemnt 1:

In your inbox you will soon receive the link to 2 files containing a Null and Alternative hypotheses as written by a classmate. Copy the Null/Alternative hypotheses onto a README.md file in your HW4 folder and identify a suitable statistical test that could be used to attempt to reject the Null hypothesis. Indicate which test you think they could use. You may need to make assumptions on the characteristics of the data that is available for this hypothetical project. If you do explicitly state the assumptions you made. Review slides https://slides.com/d/Y3OcQMw/live#/4/4 through slides https://slides.com/d/Y3OcQMw/live#/4/7 (scrolling down) to remind yourself what data types are and slides https://slides.com/d/Y3OcQMw/live#/5/1 and https://slides.com/d/Y3OcQMw/live#/5/2 to choose the test.

Dont worry about the hypothesis you had formulated in your own HW2: we will not ask you to perform this test! I realize this may be long term research that will use much more sophysticated analysis. This is just an exercise in thinking how to choose a potential statistical (NHRT) test
