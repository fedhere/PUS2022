# ASSIGNMENT


# Assignment 1 (and only)


You are encouraged to work in groups!! I advise you look for partners to work with on slack. If you need help finding a partner let me know.

**Follow instructions in the [skeleton notebook](https://github.com/fedhere/PUS2022_FBianco/blob/master/HW3/PhillyParks_instructions.ipynb)** 

You can open the notebook or create a new notebook and copy the content of the cells where needed. 

**Return the assignment by saving it to your github repository in the folder HW3**


**Add a README.md to your github repository folder HW3** that states

1 - what the homework was about in your own words

2 - who you worked with

3 - what things were you responsible 

Working in group is a great idea! strongly encouraged! Each student should turn in a notebook of their own. 

The notbeooks do not need to look different. The README should be individual and be done by yourself



Rememeber that each quesition should be answered and each figure should have a caption that discusses: what is shown, and why (i.e. what is noticeable about what is shown).

Help yourself with the resources in the classdemos, in the [PandasCh7.ipynb](https://github.com/fedhere/PUS2022_FBianco/blob/master/HW2/PandasCh7.ipynb) notebook in this folder, and in the python bootcamp https://github.com/fedhere/PyBOOT and ask questions in #hw2 on slack
