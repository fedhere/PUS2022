[What is the Question](http://fbb.space/PUS2020/reading/The%20Research%20Question-2015-Leek-1314-5.pdf) By Jeff Leek and Roger Peng. 
This paper argues that a common mistake in data science is to rush conclusions that are simply not supported by the kind of analysis that was performed. 
Note the flowchart of the data analysis in the second page and try to remember the phases of the analysis and their order.

## II - Describe a scientific hypothesis related to your own research. 
Describe it as you did in the forms above: general idea, null, and alternative hypothesis. Make sure that the quantities you are using are measurable and that you are including all possible outcomes of your experiment. Write this in a HW2/README.md file in your github repository, following proper READMe syntax and formatting the  sections the same way as in the forms: General Idea, Null Hypothesis, Alternative Hypothesis, comments on experimental design. 
To format headers in a markdown file you can use the \# symbol (more \# will make smaller headers).
